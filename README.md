Welcome to the repository for my published paper, "Online Match Prediction in Shogi using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks". This repository contains the code and scripts used to conduct the experiments and analyses discussed in the paper. It includes data preprocessing, interaction with SQL databases, and the implementation of the Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) for match prediction.

Overview

This project investigates the application of a Deep Convolutional Neural Network for predicting outcomes of Shogi matches based on historical game data. Key contributions include:

A novel feature extraction pipeline tailored for Shogi.

Integration of SQL databases for efficient data manipulation and retrieval.

Tracking and analyzing model training and performance using comet_ml.
