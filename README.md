**Data Manipulation for DCNN
**


This branch contains programs designed to process and parse a large SQLite database containing approximately 1 million SFEN strings. These scripts efficiently extract, filter, and manipulate the SFEN data to prepare it for downstream analysis. The tools are optimized for handling large-scale queries and include detailed comments to guide their use. To run these programs, ensure that SQLite is installed and the database file is accessible.
